In this project, I leveraged Python with Pandas and Numpy for in-depth HR data analysis, focusing on data cleaning by removing redundant columns, renaming, eliminating duplicates, and handling NaN values. I then used Power BI to create interactive dashboards for turnover analysis and employee wellness. The turnover analysis dashboard provided insights into employee attrition trends, while the employee wellness dashboard visualized key metrics such as overtime, job roles, and overall satisfaction. Both dashboards featured detailed visualizations, including correlation maps, and explored relationships between various factors like age, education, and distance from home.
